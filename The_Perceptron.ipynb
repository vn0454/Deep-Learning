        "Write a couple paragraphs interpreting the results with all the combinations of hyperparameters. Drawing a plot will probably help you make a point. In particular, answer the following:\n",
        "- A. Do you need to train with all the training dataset to get the highest accuracy with the test dataset?\n",
        "- B. How do you justify that training the second run obtains worse accuracy than the first one (despite the second one uses more training data)?\n",
        "   ```\n",
        "#tr: 100, epochs:  20, learning rate: 0.050; Accuracy (test, 100 instances): 71.0\n",
        "#tr: 200, epochs:  20, learning rate: 0.005; Accuracy (test, 100 instances): 68.0\n",
        "```\n",
        "- C. Can you get higher accuracy with additional hyperparameters (higher than `80.0`)?\n",
        "- D. Is it always worth training for more epochs (while keeping all other hyperparameters fixed)?\n",
        "\n",
        "#### TODO:\n",
        "A. No, training with the entire dataset is not necessary to achieve the highest accuracy. From the output of Hyperparameter tuning above, the highest accuracy (85.7%) is achieved with as few as 20 instances and is consistently observed across different learning rates and epochs. Increasing the training size beyond this does not always lead to higher accuracy, indicating that the model is able to generalize well with a smaller subset of the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "B. This is because the second run uses a lower learning rate (0.005) compared to the first run (0.050). A smaller learning rate causes slower convergence, which might not sufficiently minimize the error within the given epochs. Additionally, using more training data can increase model complexity, leading to overfitting or convergence to a local minimum, especially with a low learning rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "C. Yes, higher accuracy can be achieved by exploring additional hyperparameters, such as: high learning rates, regularization techniques, early stopping...etc\n",
        "\n",
        "D. No, training for more epochs is not always beneficial, accuracy does not consistently improve with more epochs; in some cases, it even decreases. This indicates overfitting, where the model starts memorizing noise in the training data, leading to poorer generalization on the test set. Therefore, an optimal number of epochs exists beyond which the models performance either plateaus or deteriorates, making additional training unnecessary and potentially harmful to accuracy.\n"
